Check List
- Not be able to use high gains in CoM
    - Not stiff in x
      o Increase ankle gain, increase com x gain
        + This helps a lot but needs to damp out some oscillation
        + Foot damping control
          - Zero velocity cmds for Ankles
          - Using ATI sensors
    - Not good enough tracking
    - Start vibrating when using high gains
      o QP regularization
